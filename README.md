# Software-Development-Lifecycle

# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stories" help with this?
User stories are used to gather user requirements that will be implemented into the program. The desired features of the the program are discussed between the customer(s) and 
the product owner. The product owner will then prioritize the user requirements into the product backlog for the rest of the development team to refer to. 

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
Once the requirements from the customer are established, as part of the development team, I would decide with my team what development model would be appropriate. There are 
various models that can be used, however, agile has many desired processes over other models. I hope to incorporate an iterative approach that promotes flexibility, teamwork,
and self-motivated techniques into my future development work.

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member in software development means collaborating with all members of the team, having good written and oral communication skills, being self-motivated and 
accountable, and understanding each members roles and responsibilities.
